---

- **API Diff** - track public API changes (structs, interfaces, functions, constants, variables) to catch breaking
  changes before they reach your users
- **Docs Diff** - section-aware, heading-aware, word count diff for Markdown docs to highlight meaningful content
  changes, not noisy line diffs
- **Other Files Diff** - group changes by extension (.sh, .sql, .json, etc.) to catch important migrations, scripts, and
  auxiliary file updates
- **Perfect for Release PR reviews** - helps reviewers see the real impact of each change at a glance
- **Human-friendly Release Reports in Markdown** - designed to be copy-pasted into GitHub Releases, Slack, or changelogs
- **Works great in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and locally** - easily integrates into your CI pipelines or local release
  process
- **Zero server required** - pure CLI tool - no services to deploy or manage, works entirely from your Git repo and your
  terminal

## About

`relimpact` helps you understand **what really changed** between Git refs, in a way that is:

- **Human-friendly**
- **Structured**
- **Noise-free**
- **Release-ready**

### Go Source API Changes

- Tracks changes to your **public exported API**:
    - `struct` fields
    - `interfaces` and their methods
    - `functions`
    - `methods`
    - `constants`
    - `variables`

- Built on top of **Go type system and AST parsing**:
    - Uses `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages` to understand the real API, not just text diffs.
    - **Ignores formatting changes**, reordering, comments -> only tracks semantic API impact.
    - Detects **breaking changes**, such as:
        - method signature changes
        - removed fields
        - removed types
        - changed constants
        - new API elements.

### Markdown Docs Changes

- Tracks changes in **Markdown files**:
    - any `.md` in your repo.

- Uses **Markdown AST parsing**:
    - Based on `goldmark` parser.
    - Understands:
        - Headings (added / removed)
        - Links (added / removed)
        - Images (added / removed)
        - **Section-level word count diffs** -> detect real content changes -> not noisy line diffs.

- Provides a **highly readable report**:
    - No messy raw `git diff` output.
    - Clear "Section X: 142 -> 155 words" style diffs.
    - Great for docs-heavy projects and libraries.

### Other Files Changes

- Tracks other file changes, grouped by extension:
    - `.sh`, `.sql`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.conf`, `.ini`, `.txt`, etc.

- Built on top of **Git diff**:
    - Uses `git diff --name-status` under the hood.
    - Groups files per extension -> clean, easy to review.
